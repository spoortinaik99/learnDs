# Introduction
The LearnDS project is being developed in C programming language. This project helps Students who want to learn programming get started with Data Structures with visualization, information and code. User can enter Username, which is just being used to keep a bookmark where the user left learning in previous session. The user can freely use its any feature.

## The Features and Benefits of this project
### Features

Users can see a list of techniques like linked lists, trees etc. from which they can select a technique that they would like to learn or they can go in the progressive way. After choosing from the list user provides input on the terminal, based on the input the project shows more information about the technique for user to learn. Then user can execute the technique along with visualizing it.
User can enter the username to get the bookmark where the user left off learning in the previous session. This feature is being built only to store the previous session information, and not as a login system. This project creates an external file to store the user’s data permanently, like username and bookmark.

### Benefits

* A simpler way for students who want to learn Data Structures.
* Well organized way to learn.
* Users can learn have a bookmark where they left off previously.
* Saves user time.
* Provides a better way for learning learn Data Structures by providing the execution and visualization features.
